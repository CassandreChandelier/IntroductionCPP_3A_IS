# Pokemon GAME

## What are the rules ?

The goal is simple: win the game! You'll face off in 6 Pokémon
battles against the computer. If you win 4 or more, congratulations
—you’re the champ! If you win 3 battles, well,
it's a tie, so you and the computer can call it even. 
But if you win fewer than 3, tough luck—you lose, and
the computer gets the bragging rights.

## What’s the story of the game?

You’re on an adventure through Pokemon Land, and it's absolutely 
gorgeous. You've got your trusty Pokeball by your side, ready to 
catch some wild Pokemon. As you wander through the landscape, 
you encounter a few Pokemon, and it's up to you to decide which 
ones to catch. Choose wisely!


Once you’ve rounded up all the Pokemon you want, the real action
begins. You'll pick 6 Pokemon from your Super-Pokeball. Who 
attacks first? Well, it’s random. During  each battle, 
if your Pokemon's defense is weaker than the attack power
coming its way, it’ll lose some hit points.
And if those hit points drop to zero, your Pokemon bites the dust.

So sad… but hey, that’s life!
